# Phase 2
	1. In here, we talk about optimizing our codes.
	
	2. In web application, it follows three tier architecture.
		i) Client - Browser --> less optimization
		ii) Application - IIS --> average optimization
		iii) Data - SQL Server --> high optimization
		
	3. We can solve web application performence by considering Data tier only.
	
# Phase 3
	1. Optimizing data tier.
	2. There is a tool called "Glimpse" that can getting real time diagnostics and insights into a application.
	3. To install that go to Package Manager Console and then type "install-package glimpse.mvc5" and after that execute "install-package glimpse.ef6". "ef" means Entity framework.
	4. Run then project and edit the URL as " https://localhost:44324/glimpse.axd " and it shows glimpse end-points. You can turn-on or turn-off. This dashboard only accessible via localy.
	5. Now turn on glimpse. It means glimpse put cookie on your machine and it sent back and forward with each request.
	6. Now you can navigate through the web app and in below you can see glimpse dashboard. If you click "g" icon on the dashboard, you can see various data tabs.
	
# Phase 4
	1. Optimizing application tier.
		i) Output Caching.
		ii) Data Caching.
		iii) Release Builds.
		iv) Disabling Sessions.
		
# Phase 10
	1. Optimizing client tier.
